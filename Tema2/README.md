# Regular Grammar ðŸ“š

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the concept of a regular grammar, a type of formal grammar which is particularly useful in generating and analyzing certain types of formal languages. A regular grammar consists of rules that have a single nonterminal on the left side and on the right side, either a terminal or a terminal followed by a nonterminal.

## Definition
A regular grammar can be defined as follows:
- **Left-hand side**: A single nonterminal symbol.
- **Right-hand side**: Either a single terminal symbol or a terminal symbol followed by a nonterminal symbol.

## Example of Regular Grammar
Consider the following regular grammar rules:

S -> aA
A -> aA | bB | aC
B -> bB | b
C -> c | cB

### Explanation
- `S -> aA`: Start symbol `S` transitions to `a` followed by nonterminal `A`.
- `A -> aA | bB | aC`: Nonterminal `A` can transition to `aA`, `bB`, or `aC`.
- `B -> bB | b`: Nonterminal `B` can transition to `bB` or end with `b`.
- `C -> c | cB`: Nonterminal `C` can end with `c` or transition to `cB`.

## Generated Words Examples
Here are some examples of words generated by the above grammar:

1. `S -> aA -> aaA -> aabB -> aabb`
2. `S -> aA -> aaC -> aacB -> aacbB -> aacbb`
3. `S -> aA -> abB -> abb`

## Usage
This grammar can be used to generate strings for testing parsers or for educational purposes to understand the structure and limitations of regular grammars.
